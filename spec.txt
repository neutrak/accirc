irc client (accidental IRC) (// indicates "tentatively done")
//	ncurses
//	multi-server is a must
//	different escapes for client and server commands
//		: in client window at start of message will send that raw text to the server
//		/ will send it to client command handling code
//		\: or \/ for a literal
//	tab-completed nicks (using a system very similar to what apathy IRC already does)
	needs a live search feature
//	needs to be tolerant to disconnects
//		attempt to reconnect
//		not die hard or eat RAM or some shit
//	minimal ctcp
//		ACTION, VERSION, PING
		MIRC colors //some work done but incompabilities between terminals are a nightmare
//	neulang if possible //I'll rewrite it when I have that language implemented worth a damn

todo:
	SSL support (TLS) (/sconnect)
	handle SIGHUP cleanly
	scroll-by-search feature (center searched term where possible)
