irc client (accidental IRC) (// indicates "tentatively done")
//	ncurses
//	multi-server is a must
//	different escapes for client and server commands
//		: in client window at start of message will send that raw text to the server
//		/ will send it to client command handling code
//		\: or \/ for a literal
//	tab-completed nicks (using a system very similar to what apathy IRC already does)
//	needs a live search feature
//	needs to be tolerant to disconnects
//		attempt to reconnect
//		not die hard or eat RAM or some shit
//	minimal ctcp
//		ACTION, VERSION, PING
		MIRC colors //some work done but incompabilities between terminals are a nightmare
//	neulang if possible //I'll rewrite it when I have that language implemented worth a damn

//	SSL support (TLS) (/sconnect) //openssl used for this
//	handle SIGHUP cleanly
//	scroll-by-search feature (center searched term where possible) //decided searched term should display at bottom

todo:
	add a concept of saved channel order such that channels are pre-arranged in a particular order per config file parameter
		/comment sets the channel order for the given named channels to be the same as it appears in this list
		/comment if channels are omitted, they will appear at the end of the list of channels in the order that they were joined in
		/comment this list will be compared to every JOIN, and so should be set prior to the first JOIN in order to function correctly
		/comment the raw-SERVER channel will ALWAYS appear at index 0, no matter what, and does not need to be included in this list
		/set_channel_order #channel0 #channel1 #channel2
	
	use a proper ini config file format instead of the rc file to store config
		where line order is less significant, and if a connection fails the config for the next connection isn't used incorrectly
