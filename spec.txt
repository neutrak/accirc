irc client (accidental IRC) (// indicates "tentatively done")
//	ncurses
//	multi-server is a must
//	different escapes for client and server commands
//		: in client window at start of message will send that raw text to the server
//		/ will send it to client command handling code
//		\: or \/ for a literal
//	tab-completed nicks (using a system very similar to what apathy IRC already does)
//	needs a live search feature
//	needs to be tolerant to disconnects
//		attempt to reconnect
//		not die hard or eat RAM or some shit
//	minimal ctcp
//		ACTION, VERSION, PING
		MIRC colors //some work done but incompabilities between terminals are a nightmare
//	neulang if possible //I'll rewrite it when I have that language implemented worth a damn

//	SSL support (TLS) (/sconnect) //openssl used for this
//	handle SIGHUP cleanly
//	scroll-by-search feature (center searched term where possible) //decided searched term should display at bottom

TODO for version 3.0.0:
//	finish updating server_*_command functions and calls to reflect the new and more correct parsing structure
//	handle nick changes in faux-channel (PM channel) handling
//		I think this will just be an alias to /bye <old_nick> and /hi <new_nick>, but maybe due to ordering it would get more complicated
	update unicode handling
		display in channel output without extra spaces and with wrapping that uses the full screen width
		allow input behaviour to act like it does for any other character, no weird backspace issues, etc.
	clean up comments, todos, error_log output, etc. to reflect the current state
